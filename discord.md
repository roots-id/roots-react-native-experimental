## How to Receive a Verifiable Credential Issued by a Discord Bot using the PRISM API
Introduction
The PRISM API is a beta service that allows developers to issue verifiable credentials through their applications. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of receiving a verifiable credential from a Discord bot using the PRISM API.

### Prerequisites
Before you can receive a verifiable credential, you will need the following:

- A Discord account
- Access to a Discord (bot)[https://discord.gg/YXJ3kCDk]  that can issue verifiable credentials using the PRISM API
- An application that can verify the verifiable credential using the PRISM API
### Steps
Start by opening Discord and logging into your account.
Go to the server where the Discord bot is (located)[https://discord.gg/YXJ3kCDk].
Type the command to request a verifiable credential from the bot. For example, the bot has a command "/issue" 
The bot will respond with a QR code which is an invitation generated by PRISM API, where you can claim your verifiable credential.
Go to the root wallet and then scan the qr code.
You can either view it or accept it.
Once accepted wait for the credential to be issued to your wallet
